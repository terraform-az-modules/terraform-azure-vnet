We are a group of DevOps engineers and architects collaborating to build standardized, scalable, and secure infrastructure in today's ever-evolving digital landscape. Rooted in a strong belief in automation and modular design—much like microservices—we focus on decomposing infrastructure into smaller, reusable components such as databases, clusters, and more. These components are built to follow industry best practices and are easy to manage, scale, and secure.

This repository is part of the **terraform-az-modules** organization and provides open-source, reusable Terraform modules. It includes practical examples and workflows to help users quickly understand, implement, and improve their infrastructure with minimal configuration and high maintainability.


## Prerequisites and Providers


This table contains both Prerequisites and Providers:


| Description   | Name                                       | Version   |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------------------:|:---------:|
| **Prerequisite** | [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) | >= 1.6.6 |
| **Provider** | [azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) | >= 3.90.0 |





## Examples

**IMPORTANT:** Since the master branch used in source varies based on new modifications, we recommend using the [release versions](https://github.com/terraform-az-modules/terraform-azure-vnet/releases).

📌 For additional usage examples, check the complete list under [`examples/`](./examples) directory.



Here is the **Inputs and Outputs** section for your **VNet module** in clean and consistent README format, based on the inputs and outputs you've provided:
